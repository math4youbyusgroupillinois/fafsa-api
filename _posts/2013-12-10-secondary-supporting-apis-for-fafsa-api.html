     I made the core read / write endpoints for the FAFSA applications, this week I focused on deploying a series of read only APIs to support developers when building FAFSA driven applications in education.
</p>
<p>
     While I'm still evaluating some potential other datasets here are the ones I've published so far:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>FAFSA Fields</strong> - An endpoint providing a list of fields on the FAFSA form
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>States</strong> - An endpoint providing a list of states and provinces in the US and Canada
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Rejection Codes</strong> - Potential rejection codes for the FAFSA application
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Conditional Procedures</strong> - Conditional procedures to process a FAFSA application
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     I'm currently queueing up another supporting API endpoint of secondary schools in the United States. It is a rather large data set, so it is taking some time to process and turn into a usable API.
</p>
<p>
     If there are other API endpoints you'd like to see, feel free to submit as an issue on the project's Github repository and I'll consider adding into the project roadmap.
