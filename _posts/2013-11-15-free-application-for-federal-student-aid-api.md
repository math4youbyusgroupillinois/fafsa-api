<p>I was asked to help put some thought into an API for the Free Application for Federal Student Aid iniative. First, what is FAFSA:</p>

<blockquote>The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is the form the U.S. Department of Education (ED) requires to determine your Expected Family Contribution (EFC). The government conducts a “need analysis” based on financial information, such as income, assets, and other family information, which you (and your parents if you are a dependent student) will be asked to provide.</blockquote>

<p>I'm just getting started with this project, and as I do with all my Public / Private Sector work, I created this umbrella site for my Department of Education open data and API work, and created an individual project site just for the Free Application for Federal Student Aid API.</p>

<p>You can participate in the design and development process via the Gitihub repository, and feel free to ping me @kinlane if you want to get involved. I will post stories here, and on the individual site to chronical its progress, and reference on API Evangelist when applicable.</p>

<p>Next up, understanding what the details of the FAFSA form are, and start considering what some possible architectural designs might work for FAFSA...</p>
