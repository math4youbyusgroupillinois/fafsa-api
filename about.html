<h2>About This Project</h2>

<p>I was asked to help provide some example of what is possible around building an API for the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form. This project is a real-time snapshot of my contributions to this effort.</p>

<p>I have developed a basic server side API, supporting portal, code sampels, blog, roadmap and other essential elements to move the efforts forward. The goal is to stimulate developers to build applications around a common FAFSA API definition and data model, while also providing open source tooling so that some can deploy their own API.</p>

<p>All of this project is hosted on Github and is provided under an MIT license. I need help, from anyone who is interested to move this project forward, fund the work and contribute in any way. You can submit comments as Github issues or feel free to ping me directly @kinlane.</p>
