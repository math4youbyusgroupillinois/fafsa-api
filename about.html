<h2>About This Project</h2>

<p>I was asked to help provide an example of what is possible when building an API for the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form. This project is a real-time snapshot of my contributions to this effort as I have time.</p>

<p>I have developed a basic server side API, supporting portal, code sampels, blog, roadmap and other essential elements to move the project forward. The goal is to stimulate developers to build applications around a common FAFSA API definition and data model, while also providing open source tooling so that you can also deploy your own API.</p>

<p>All of this project is hosted on Github and is provided under an MIT license. I need help, from anyone who is interested to move this project forward, fund the work and contribute in any way.</p>

<p>You can submit comments as Github issues or feel free to ping me directly @kinlane, I am solely responsible for everything you see.</p> 

<p>This is a work in progress, meant to understand how to best work with Department of Education data and APIs, if you have feedback leave comments below.</p>

<p>This site is not an official Department of Education project, Kin Lane (<a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">@kinlane</a>) is solely responsible for its contents.</p>
