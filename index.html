<h2>Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) API</h2>

<p>I was asked to help put some thought into an API for the Free Application for Federal Student Aid iniative. First, what is FAFSA:</p>

<blockquote>The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is the form the U.S. Department of Education (ED) requires to determine your Expected Family Contribution (EFC). The government conducts a “need analysis” based on financial information, such as income, assets, and other family information, which you (and your parents if you are a dependent student) will be asked to provide.</blockquote>

<p>I'm just getting started with this project, and as I do with all my Public / Private Sector work, I created <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/developer/index.html">this umbrella site for my Department of Education open data and API work</a>, and created an individual project site just for the <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/developer/index.html">Free Application for Federal Student Aid API</a>.</p>

<p>You can participate in the design and development process via the <a href="https://github.com/ed-data">Gitihub repositories</a>, and feel free to ping me @kinlane if you want to get involved. I will post stories here, and on the individual site to chronical its progress, and reference on API Evangelist when applicable.</p>

<p>Next up, understanding what the details of the FAFSA form are, and start considering what some possible architectural designs might work for FAFSA.</p>

<p>This is a work in progress, meant to understand how to best work with Department of Education data and APIs, if you have feedback leave comments below.</p>
